            That's right, album number ten, short dawg's in the house
            It's gettin' close to the end y'all
            But we gonna kick it like this on the last album
            
            Now let me holler at ya partner, spit this game
            In you ear for a minute, quit complaining
            Bout how you can't spend it cause you ain't got it
            You got what it takes but not enough to get started
            I hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's
            Just me ridin legit, they can't arrest me or bust me
            
            I'm still hungry, I want some more stuff
            Get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
            So get yours, and buy my new album
            Peep the game and don't be like Calvin
            Get everything you want, get real, get you mail
            Get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jai
